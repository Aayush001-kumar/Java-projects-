## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User sets up a 4-digit PIN** and **initial account balance**
2. PIN verification is required to proceed
3. Main menu offers four options:
    - `1` → Check Balance
    - `2` → Deposit Amount
    - `3` → Withdraw Amount
    - `4` → Exit the program
4. Proper input validation ensures safe and user-friendly interaction
